This folder is an experimantal addition to this project to show the use case of augmented relaity by using bare image processing and augmentation. This code was executed on the smartglasses that we built(images can be found in the Hackereart submission page)
This device is a Raspberry Pi Zero. A size of a coin. Along with touch sensors which can be worn by the user and based on his line of sight the camera attached to the RPI would get this data which is processed by the above code to generate a context.
This context is used and based on users input via the touch sensors the command is given to the IoT service which controls the device. 

A Sci-fi example: User can turn on and turn off the device by just looking at the device and tapping a sensor. Isnt it cool? :D
